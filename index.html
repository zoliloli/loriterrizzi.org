Terrizzi holds an MFA from Columbia University in Film and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Rutgers College, where she was awarded the Vanderbilt Scholarship for the Study of Art & Music. Goaloop is the product of her life-long focus on freedom, issues of identity, and study of the relationship between words and images, form and content, equity and ability, truth and memory, power and substance, one of us and all of us. The story "Raising Liberty: The Construction of the Statue of Liberty as Reconstruction Was Under Attack" served as a metaphor for the construction of Goaloop and can be <a href="https://medium.com/@goaloop/raising-liberty-1235946119aa" target="_blank">read here</a>; it is being made into a movie.
