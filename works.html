                <p class="works-desc works-indent">With a background in art and art history, an MFA in Film, and having lived in Florence, Italy, Renaissance architects were at the forefront of my mind as I designed Goaloop; both architecture and the Internet are mathematical landscapes. Designing blueprints with musical harmonic principles for more harmonious structures, they believed mathematical harmony reflected a divine order that produced not only aural, but also aesthetic and spatial beauty, creating forms that align with moral excellence and, in the hands of Leonardo da Vinci, physical well-being. I sought to apply a similar philosophy when designing Goaloop (in beta at <a href="https://goaloop.com" target="_blank">Goaloop.com</a>).</p>

                <p class="works-desc works-indent">Goaloop grew from Toni Morrison's rose to bloom the entire world. This visual progression, her long-stemmed, single crimson rose, taking root as if a seed, was with me as I taught myself to code Goaloop's demo site, hand-drawing every image to reflect human creativity over machine. This process met the influence of Renaissance artists, turning Goaloop's structure into a flower that blooms as a fractal that infinitely blooms others. This mirrors Ms. Morrison's response when an admirer handed her this rose: to give it to another special someone, rippling appreciation and generosity. Goaloop cultivates fertile digital soil to help everyone <a href="/about.html">grow into who they were born to be</a>, regardless of parentage or zip code.</p>

                <p class="works-desc">Memoir, including the making of Goaloop (unpublished). Excerpt:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Dear Dr. King,</p>
                    <p>We are still struggling to grow a system of peace and equality from the violent and unequal system at our roots. The economic movement you sparked in the days before your death is unfinished. How much longer will it take to reform our economic system? How many more lives and lifetimes and libraries will this take?</p>
                    <p>What if we were to start all over again, knowing what we know now? What if we could create a brand new economic system that would work within the current one, accepting of the status quo, and, as it is adopted, would grow us out of our unequal system and into one created for growth by all from the start? If love has never been a popular movement, our new system could teach love like our one now tempts hate.</p>
                    <p>I'm writing to you in Riverside Church, a short walk from where I now live. When I entered, they were tuning the organs for Easter service. I listened to your speech again from April 4, 1967 while seated in the second pew. I went downstairs to look for a tabletop to write this letter, finding only dark hallways and a bright basketball court.</p>
                    <p>Someone directed me to a location upstairs, and when I reached it, I couldn't believe my eyes: there is a large photograph of you under an arch. I'm looking up at you as I write this letter. I was born days after your assassination, on Easter Sunday. We've transcribed your words into code. We have built a new edifice."</p>

                <p class="works-desc">Essay (unpublished)</p>
                <p class="works-desc works-indent">How do we reconcile that we often want privacy for ourselves yet transparency from others online? Goaloop's system resolves this paradox. Excerpt:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"As we become more connected electronically, we know each other less, isolated in worlds of agreement as algorithms draw smaller islands around each of us. Seeking agreement is a form of comfort, an understandable temptation in an unjust world.</p>
                    <p>But these algorithms have been written to serve private profits, not us. Their collateral damage has been a stripping of our emotional investment in each other, of our exploration of each other. The result is a teaching of our emotional divestment in the other.</p>
                    <p>Losing control of our private data, trust, and the roots and joys that trust brings, we are unmooring ourselves from each other. As we drift apart, our need for belonging is still anchored within us, making us susceptible to open arms that claim us, including violent ones. It's sometimes hard to see a revolution underway other than the quiet gutting of our inner lives in exchange for outer ones, shells easily filled by the strongest predator, while we're swept away by content streams throughout the day."</p>
